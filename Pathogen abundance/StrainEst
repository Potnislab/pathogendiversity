The abundance of Xanthomonas perforans was done using the reference-based strain abundance pipeline StrainEst (https://github.com/compmetagen/strainest)


Step 1
Load the module and nake a alignment file with the reference genome
#!/bin/bash
module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
strainest mapgenomes Xp_LH3.fna Xp_91-118.fna Xp_AL33.fna Xp_AL57.fna Xp_AL65.fna Xp_ALS7E.fna Xp_GEV993.fna Xp_LH3.fna MR.fna

NOTE: the initials genomes are the representative strain genomes, the second genome is the genome of species representative (SR), and the final MR file is a file containing an aligned file. This step is to first identify if you have perforans or euvesicatoria in your sample. For only perforans we use the following code.

Step 2
Now, the positions that were variable in at least one genome and their allelic variants were recorded in the SNV matrix snp.dgrp
#!/bin/bash
module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
strainest map2snp Xp_LH3.fna MR.fna snp.dgrp 
(Note: 91-118.fna is our SR)

Step 3
Now compute the number of sites where the vectors differ from each pair of sequences, followed by a complete linkage hierarchical clustering with an identity threshold of 99%. the distance matrix was calculated by
#!/bin/bash
module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
strainest snpdist snp.dgrp snp_dist.txt hist.pdf 

Step 4
After that, the clustered SNV matrix was computed using;

#!/bin/bash
module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
strainest snpclust snp.dgrp snp_dist.txt snp_clust.dgrp clusters.txt 

Step 5
Again, the representative genomes were aligned against the species representative (SR) 
#!/bin/bash
module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
strainest mapgenomes Xp_LH3.fna Xp_91-118.fna Xp_AL33.fna Xp_AL57.fna Xp_AL65.fna Xp_ALS7E.fna Xp_GEV993.fna Xp_LH3.fna MR.fna

Step 6
then, the bowtie index was build
#!/bin/bash
 module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
 bowtie2-build -f MA.fna MA

Step 7
then, the quality trimmed reads were aligned against the bowtie database
#!/bin/bash
source /opt/asn/etc/asn-bash-profiles-special/modules.sh
module load bowtie2/2.2.9
for fq1 in ./*_L004.paired.1.fq
    do
    echo "working with file $fq1"

    base=$(basename $fq1 _L004.paired.1.fq)
    echo "base name is $base"

    fq1=./${base}_L004.paired.1.fq
    fq2=./${base}_L004.paired.2.fq

bowtie2 --very-fast --no-unal -x MA -1 $fq1 -2 $fq2 -S ${base}.sam

done


Step 8
The sorted and indexed BAM file was created.

#!/bin/bash
source /opt/asn/etc/asn-bash-profiles-special/modules.sh
module load samtools/1.11
for f in ./*.sam
 do
   echo $f
   base=$(echo ${f} | sed 's/.sam//')
   echo $base

   # Convert file from SAM to BAM format
   samtools view -b $f > ${base}.bam

   # Sort BAM file
   samtools sort ${base}.bam -o ${base}.sorted.bam

   # index the bam file
   samtools index ${base}.sorted.bam

 done

Step 9
Finally, to predict the strain abundance, run the following command in the metagenomics directory.
#!/bin/bash
source /opt/asn/etc/asn-bash-profiles-special/modules.sh
module load anaconda/2-5.2.0
for file in ./*.sorted.bam
    do
    echo "working with file1 $file"

    base=$(basename $file .sorted.bam)
    echo "base name is $base"

strainest est snp_clust.dgrp $file ./${base}

done
