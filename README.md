## Abstract

Recurring outbreaks caused by endemic pathogens present a significant challenge to growers. Thus, understanding the risk factors involved in fueling the continued outbreaks and pathogen evolution is a priority. Our understanding of the pathogen population structure has largely been guided by isolate genome sequencing efforts. However, this approach can overlook the importance of co-occurring pathogenic genera, species or even lineages of the same pathogenic species. In this study, we aimed to monitor pathogen population dynamics at a much fine-scale resolution, tap into the genetic variation existing and emerging in the fields, and understand the determinants of this diversity in the *Xanthomonas*-tomato pathosystem. Using strain-resolved metagenomics, we found that pathogen heterogeneity is common across the fields, and higher disease severity is associated with higher pathogen diversity. The finding of differential pathogen dynamics in the neighboring states led us to further dissect the contributions of environmental variables and production scales on driving the dynamics using multivariate models. We find that climatic fluctuations can modify the endemic disease risk and significantly drive pathogen evolution. The co-occurring pathogen lineages can provide a fitness advantage to the population under climatic fluctuations by allowing them to quickly adapt via variable fitness contributions, depending on the environment. Furthermore, our study on predicting evolutionary divergence revealed evidence of parallel evolution, characterized by fluctuations in allelic frequencies across seasons and the presence of positive selection within the pathogen population. The findings from this study can inform on fitness strategies adopted by endemic pathogens and how pathogens may evolve under changing climate.
